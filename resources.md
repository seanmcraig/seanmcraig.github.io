I have collected a selection of my publicly-available materials on this page. In general, I make everything available through my <a href="https://github.com/seanmcraig">GitHub profile</a>. I post new, experimental, and fun code snippets on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanmcraig">GitHub Gist</a> page.

#### Intro to R for Empirical Research

I maintain a sequence of R lessons aimed at undegraduates in political science (and related fields) and based on materials I use in the classroom. Graduate students who are completely new to R may also find the resources useful. 

You can access the lessons, R scripts, and data by cloning or downloading <a href="">this Github repository</a>.

#### R Packages
I have several R packages in casual development. See the package README files for installation instructions.

* <a href="https://github.com/seanmcraig/scfunctions">scfunctions</a>: An package collecting my useful and/or amusing R functions.
* <a href="https://github.com/seanmcraig/stata2r">stata2R</a>: An R package that translates some Stata code into functional R code. Potentially useful as a learning tool.


#### Linux Resources
* <a href="https://github.com/seanmcraig/arch-setup/doc.pdf">Setting Up Arch Linux for Home Use</a>: PDF instructions for producing a functional, reproducable Arch Linux system in a reasonable amount of time.
