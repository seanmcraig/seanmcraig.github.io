I am Adjunct Professor of Political Science at La Roche University and a doctoral candidate in political science at the <a href="https://polisci.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh</a>. I specialize in American politics and research methodology. Additionally, I hold a JD from Washington University in St. Louis. My research has focused primarily on the legitimacy and behavior of US state courts. Other research interests include elections, litigation, and public opinion. 

As a teacher, my portfolio includes courses covering American political institutions, national and state-level, and data analysis using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a>. I also frequently advise undegraduates who are preparing for law school.

I have resources for learning R available on the <a href="./resources.html">Resources</a> page.
