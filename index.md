I am a doctoral candidate in political science at the <a href="https://polisci.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh</a>, where I specialize in American politics and research methodology. Additionally, I hold a JD from Washington University in St. Louis. My dissertation-in-progress considers the mechanics and consequences of institutional legitimacy in local US courts. My other research interests include judicial elections, litigation, and public opinion.

As a teacher, my portfolio includes courses covering American political institutions, national and state-level, and data analysis using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a>. I also frequently advise undegraduates who are preparing for law school.
