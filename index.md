I'm a Nashville-based social scientist, researcher, puzzle-lover, and absolutely shameless cat-dad. I hold an MA in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh, where I'm currently ABD, and a JD from Washington University in St. Louis. Previously, I taught courses on data analysis and US politics at several Pittsburgh-area colleges.
